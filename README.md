# About this project
Enigma Espresso Cafe Sales Analysis

# Project Description:

For this project, I analyzed sales data from Enigma Espresso Cafe using Excel to uncover valuable insights. I started by organizing the data, extracting month, weekday names, and hours from the date section, and ensuring all numbers were in the right format.

I created formulas in Excel to calculate metrics like average order value and total footfall. These measures helped me understand customer spending habits and the busiest times during the day. Using Excel's charts and graphs, I visualized sales patterns by month, peak customer visit times, and sales distribution across different weekdays. These visuals provided a clear picture of the cafe's performance over time.

# Key Insights:

# Top Categories: 
Coffee and Tea are the most popular categories, generating the highest percentage of sales.

These beverages are staple choices for many customers, providing a quick, enjoyable pick-me-up. The wide variety of coffee and tea options also caters to diverse tastes, making them consistently popular choices.

# Busiest Days: 
Mondays, Thursdays, and Fridays are the busiest days for the cafe.
Mondays: Many people start their week with a coffee to boost their productivity. It’s a common day for meetings and planning sessions, leading to increased foot traffic.
Thursdays and Fridays: These days are close to the weekend, and people often treat themselves or meet friends and colleagues for a coffee. Fridays, in particular, see a rise as people celebrate the end of the workweek.

# Peak Hours: 
Products sell in the highest quantities at 8, 9, and 10 AM.

Morning hours are when people typically start their day, grabbing coffee and breakfast items on their way to work or during their morning routines. This makes these hours critical for sales.

# Top Store: 
The Hell's Kitchen store leads in revenue, bringing in $236,511.17.

Hell's Kitchen is located in a high-traffic area with many offices, residential buildings, or tourist attractions. This prime location can drive higher customer footfall and sales.

# Top 5 Products:

Ethiopian Coffee: $42,304.10

Jamaican Coffee River: $38,781.15

Sustainably Grown Organic: $39,065.10

Brazilian Coffee: $37,746.50

Latte: $36,369.75

These products have unique flavors or qualities that appeal to customers. Specialty coffees and popular items like lattes often attract repeat purchases due to their distinctive taste and quality.

# Total Sales: The total sales amount to $698,812.33.

This overall figure reflects the cumulative success of the cafe’s offerings and operational efficiency.

# Average Order Value: The average order value is $1.44.

This relatively low average suggests that most customers are purchasing single items or small orders, which is typical for a coffee shop setting.

# Total Footfall: The cafe recorded a total footfall of 149,116 customers.

High footfall indicates a strong customer base and consistent traffic, likely due to the cafe's popular location, product offerings, and customer service.

# Average Bill Per Person: The average bill per person is $4.69.

This suggests that customers often purchase additional items like pastries or snacks along with their coffee, increasing the average spend per visit.

# Monthly Sales: 

The breakdown of total sales by month shows a steady increase, peaking in June:

January: $81,677.74

February: $76,145.19

March: $98,834.68

April: $118,941.08

May: $156,727.76

June: $166,485.88

The increase in sales over the months could be due to factors like seasonal promotions, increased customer loyalty, and the growing popularity of the cafe.

# How Cafe can improve it's Operations and Customer Experience:

To enhance operations and customer experience at Enigma Espresso Cafe, the management could introduce promotions and loyalty programs targeting peak days and hours to encourage repeat business. Expanding the menu with more popular items like specialty coffees and pastries could attract more customers. Additionally, optimizing staffing during busy periods like Monday mornings and late weekdays ensures efficient service. Enhancing the ambiance and offering limited-time seasonal beverages can also draw in more Customers, driving both footfall and sales.
